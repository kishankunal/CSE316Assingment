Question N0-10

Write a C program to solve the following problem:

Suppose that a disk drive has 5 ,000 cylinders, numbered 0 to 4999. The drive is currently serving a request at cylinder 143 , and the previous request was at cylinder 125. The queue of pending requests, in FIFO Order, is: 86 , 1470, 913 , 1774, 948, 1509, 1022, 175 0, 130 Starting from the current head position, what is the total distance (in cylinders) that the disk arm moves to satisfy all the pending requests for each of the SCAN disk-scheduling algorithms?


Solution : First come, first served (FCFS) is an operating system process scheduling algorithm

and a network routing management mechanism that automatically executes queued requests and processes by the order of their arrival. With first come, first served, what comes first is handled first; the next request in line will be executed once the one before it is complete.

FCFS provides an efficient, simple and error-free process scheduling algorithm that saves valuable CPU resources. It uses non-preemptive scheduling in which a process is automatically queued and processing occurs according to an incoming request or process order. FCFS derives its concept from real-life customer service.

Let's take a look at how FCFS process scheduling works. Suppose there are three processes in a

queue: P1, P2 and P3. P1 is placed in the processing register with a waiting time of zero seconds and 10 seconds for complete processing. The next process, P2 , must wait 10 seconds and is placed in the processing cycle until P1 is processed. Assuming that P2 will take 15 seconds to complete, the final process, P3, must wait 25 seconds to be processed. FCFS may not be the fastest process scheduling algorithm, as it does not check for priorities associated with processes. These priorities may depend on the processes' individual execution times.
